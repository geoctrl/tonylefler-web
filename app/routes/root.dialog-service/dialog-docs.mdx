# Dialog Service

:: A window of content placed on top of the viewport, rendering the content
underneath inert.

## Doing something different

### Problem

Dialogs/modals are commonly written as components. Rendering these dialogs
typically involves managing their "display" state in the parent component and
passing callbacks like `onSubmit` to it. While this works, the parent component
must manage the dialog's state and behavior, which results in duplicated logic
across all consumers of it. Even if you write an abstraction for this
functionality, this state management is still required for all consumers... and
it's cumbersome.

### Solution

The `dialogService` aims to solve these problems by providing tooling that
allows them to be extremely reusable with minimal boilerplate. Opening a dialog
is as easy as calling a function. The dialog opens in a `DialogEntry` component
rendered in the root of your application.

The ultimate goal is ease of reusability. Writing your dialog in a custom hook
affords all of the above:

```tsx
// abstraction
function useHelloWorldDialog() {
  return useDialog(() => <div>Hello, World!</div>);
}

// implementation
function ParentComponent() {
  const myDialog = useHelloWorldDialog();
  return <Button onClick={() => myDialog()}>Open modal</Button>;
}
```
