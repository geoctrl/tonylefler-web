import { Button } from "root";

### isActive

```
isActive?: boolean;
```

`isActive` is a manual way of setting the "active" state of the button. The
style is the same as its "active" (pressed) state.

This prop is useful in scenarios where you need to manually set the active state
of the button, such as when the button is a dropdown trigger and the dropdown is
open.

<Button>Normal state</Button>
<Button isActive>Active state</Button>

```tsx
<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button>Normal state</Button>
  <Button isActive>Active state</Button>
</div>
```
