import { Button } from "stem-ui";

### isActive

```
isActive?: boolean;
```

`isActive` is a manual way of setting the "active" state of the button. The
style is the same as its "active" (pressed) state.

This prop is useful in scenarios where you

<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button>Normal state</Button>
  <Button isActive>Active state</Button>
</div>

```tsx
<Button>Normal state</Button>
<Button isActive>Active state</Button>
```
